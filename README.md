# ConsoleChass
A Match of Chess made as final project on a course. This application was realized with OOP techiniquies, wich has provided a wide knowlege in logics, to connect all the component's logics to make an outstanding game. It was deep in logics, using components as inherence, polimorfism, lists and some other rules. It was very clarifyer to understand and to put the concepts to work all toghter, giving the sensation to build a real thing, that has no limits.
